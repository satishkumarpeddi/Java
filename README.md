## 📌 About

This repository is a **learning-oriented collection** of Java programs covering a wide range of topics:

- Fundamental **algorithms** (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming)  
- Classic **data structures** (AVL tree, Binary Search Tree, Queues, etc.)  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts & examples  
- Recursion, patterns, threads, concurrency, and utilities  
- Real code you can compile & run immediately  

Each example is meant to deepen your understanding of core Java and give you **hands-on practice with real code**. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🛠 Getting Started — Step by Step

### 📥 Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/satishkumarpeddi/Java.git
cd Java


📦 Requirements

You’ll need:

Java JDK 8+

Any Java-capable IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code) or command-line tools.

▶️ Compile & Run Examples
Compile a single file:

javac path/to/FileName.java
Run the class:
java FileName


Example — compile and run Binary Search Tree:

javac BinarySearchTree.java
java BinarySearchTree

Compile all files (if no packages used):
find . -name "*.java" -print | xargs javac


TIP: If the repo uses packages, run from root and use the fully qualified class names.

📌 Recommended Learning Path

If you’re new to Java:

Start with OOP examples (JavaOOPs/, Abstraction/)

Move to basic patterns (Pattern/) and recursion (Recursion/)

Learn sorting & algorithmic logic (ExternalSorting/, Trees/)

Try threading and concurrency (ThreadingConcept.java)

This path takes you from basics to intermediate real-world code.
