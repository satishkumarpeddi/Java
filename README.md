# Java (Collection of Algorithms & OOP Examples)

> A curated, well-documented "super README" for the repository `satishkumarpeddi/Java` — a learning-focused collection of Java algorithm implementations, data structures, and OOP examples.

---

## Repository overview

This repository is a large collection of Java example programs and class files covering:

* Fundamental data structures and algorithms (AVL trees, Binary Search Tree, sorting algorithms, search algorithms).
* Object-Oriented Programming concepts and examples (abstraction, interfaces, inheritance, anonymous classes).
* Algorithmic challenges and utilities (palindrome checks, K‑anagram, Kadane's algorithm, sieve of Eratosthenes, sliding-window problems).
* Miscellaneous utilities and example programs for practicing Java (file handling, recursion, pattern exercises).

The codebase is organized into folders such as `Abstraction`, `Coupling`, `ExternalSorting`, `JavaOOPs`, `Pattern`, `Recursion`, `Rotation`, `TempFile`, `Trees` and many standalone `.java` and `.class` files.

---

## Highlights (examples you'll find here)

* `AVL.java` — AVL tree implementation (self-balancing BST).
* `BinarySearchTree.java` — classic BST operations.
* `MergeToSortArray.java`, `MegreSortLinkedList.java`, `QuickSortingUsingArrayList.java` — sorting algorithms.
* `KadanesAlgo.java`, `SlidingWindow.java`, `SieveofEratosthenes.java` — common algorithmic patterns.
* OOP examples: `Abstraction.java`, `Interface.java`, `SingleInheritanceHavingAnonymousClass.java`.

## Goals for a "Super README"

This README will:

1. Explain the purpose and scope of the repo.
2. Show a clear folder/file map so contributors and learners find examples fast.
3. Provide quick usage instructions (how to compile & run).
4. Recommend code-style and testing suggestions.
5. Include contribution guidelines and an easy template for PRs/Issues.
6. Suggest a license and contact/author info.

---

## Quick start — compile & run

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/satishkumarpeddi/Java.git
cd Java
```

2. Compile a single file (example: `BinarySearchTree.java`):

```bash
javac path/to/BinarySearchTree.java
java <FullyQualifiedClassName>
```

3. Compile all `.java` files from repository root (not recommended for very large trees if packages are used):

```bash
find . -name "*.java" -print | xargs javac
```

4. Running classes in packages: use the repository root as the classpath and run with the fully-qualified package name.

## Recommended README additions (what I added in this SUPER_README)

* A one-line description at the top that makes the repo discoverable via search engines.
* Usage examples for common files (command lines to compile & run).
* A CONTRIBUTING.md pointer: small checklist for PRs, testing, and code style (Java 11+ target, 4-space indent, Javadoc for public classes/methods).
* A simple `examples/` directory idea that demonstrates input/output for a few key programs.

---

## Contribution guidelines (short)

1. Fork the repo and create a topic branch per change: `feature/<what-you-fixed>`.
2. Add Javadoc-style comments for new classes and public methods.
3. Add a short test input and expected output to an `examples/` folder when adding algorithm programs.
4. Create a PR with a clear title and description; link to related issues.

---

## Suggested LICENSE

If you want others to reuse and contribute without restrictions, add an `MIT` license. If you prefer more restrictions, choose `Apache-2.0` or `GPL-3.0` depending on your needs.

---

## Maintenance & next steps (suggestions)

* Add a small `scripts/` folder with build/run helpers (shell scripts or Gradle/Maven wrappers).
* Normalize package declarations so files live in packages and the build is reproducible.
* Add unit tests (JUnit) for algorithm correctness.
* Add a small `README_EXAMPLES.md` that shows sample inputs/outputs for 6–10 representative programs.

---

## Contact

Repo owner: `satishkumarpeddi` — please add an `author` or `maintainers` block to the README so people know how to ask questions.

---

## Credits

This README was generated to make the repository friendlier for learners and contributors. If you'd like, I can also:

* Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `LICENSE` files.
* Open a PR with the README and suggested repository reorganizations.
* Convert a few chosen `.java` examples into a small Maven/Gradle project with tests.
