AtomicInteger 
BitSet
In Java, all threads have a default priority of 5, unless explicitly changed using the setPriority method.
An anonymous class is created using the new keyword.
Unlike ArrayList, a LinkedList has no predefined size.
RandomAccess is a marker interface to indicate that a collection supports fast random access.
'A new object is always created in young space. Once young space is full, a special young collection is run where objects which have lived long enough are moved to old space and memory is freed up in young space for new objects.
When an object is no longer referenced, it may be reclaimed by the garbage collector. If an object declares a finalizer, the finalizer is executed before the object is reclaimed to give the object a last chance to clean up resources that would not otherwise be released. When a class is no longer needed, it may be unloaded.
The stack memory size depends on the JVM and operating system.
By default, InputStreamReader uses the platformâ€™s default encoding, which is UTF-8 on most systems.
The default priority of thread is 5
A WeakHashMap allows keys to be garbage collected if there are no strong references to them.
LinkedList in Java is implemented as a doubly linked list.
A mark and sweep garbage collection consists of two phases, the mark phase and the sweep phase. I mark phase all the objects reachable by java threads, native handles and other root sources are marked alive and others are garbage. In the sweep phase, the heap is traversed to find gaps between live objects and the gaps are marked free list used for allocating memory to new objects.

Sieve Algorithm 
Lambda expressions, introduced in Java 8, enable functional programming in Java.
PrintWriter uses the platform's default encoding unless specified otherwise.
ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array, while LinkedList uses a doubly linked list.
A StringBuilder has a default capacity of 16 characters.

Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile time. Example ArrayOutOfIndexException
A CopyOnWriteArrayList has a default capacity of 16.
The default value of a char is '\u0000' (null character).
There are two ways to request a JVM to run a garbage collector. These are the System.gc() method and the Runtime.getRuntime().gc() method.
1MB (megabyte) = 8388608 bits.
